# Overview of the analysis:

The CEO of PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company, has asked for a compelling visualization of all the rideshare data from January through April of 2019. This analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affortability for under-served neighborhoods.

# Results :
The following key metrics were calculated to observe and analyze some disparities in city type.
The summary DataFrame shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each type of city. There were 66 urban, 36 suburban, and 18 rural cities in the data. The total number of rides for each type of city matches what we might expect; the total of 1,625 rides in urban cities is the highest and the total of 125 rides in rural cities is the lowest. The total number of drivers and the total fares for each city type also follow this pattern.
Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride in Rural ($34.62) , suburban ($ 30. 97), urban cities average Fare  per ride ($24.53).
we can see here ride summary in the bellow DataFrame :

 The "Toal Fares by City Type" graph shows the differences in weekly total fares from January to April. Urban cities have the highest total fares ranging from $1,661.68 to $2,470.93 as shown by the yellow line. The red line shows that the total fares in suburban cities which ranges from $721.60 to $1,412.74 on a weekly basis. The lowest total fares is depicted by the blue line for rural cities and ranges from $67.65 to $501.24. In late February, the total fares in all types of cities seem to be at their highest. The relationship between total fares and date is depicted in the graph below:
 Finally we can see in this line chart*** Urban ***area is the highest total Fare by City Type.

 # summary : 

1. Based on the results, one recommendation to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types is hiring more drivers in rural and suburban cities or cutting down the number of drivers in urban cities This would help even out the total number of drivers and the average fare per driver in each type of city.
 2.  Another recommendation to the CEO is to target marketing towards rural and suburban cities. By increasing the amount of users in these areas, the total fares and the total number of rides would increase thereby alleviating the disparity.
 3.  A third recommendation for addressing disparities among city types is decreasing the fares in rural and suburban cities or increasing the fares in urban cities. This would even out the total fares and the average fares per ride and may also help fix the disparity in the total number of rides in each type of city.
